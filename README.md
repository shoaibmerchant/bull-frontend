bull-frontend
=============

Based on the REST API/Socket.IO in my forked repo of bull (job manager), this is a pure JS based frontend to monitor queues &amp; progress.

UPDATE: I have stopped work on this as I switched to a custom hook-based queue manager as bull couldnt solve certain business requirements.
